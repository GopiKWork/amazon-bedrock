**Dealer:** Lakeside Honda  
**Customer:** Mrs. Janet T.  
**Vehicle:** 2021 Honda Civic EX  
**Case Start Date:** September 8, 2024

On the morning of September 8, 2024, Mrs. Janet T. brought her 2021 Honda Civic EX into the Lakeside Honda service center after experiencing what she described as “strange behavior” with her vehicle. According to Mrs. T., the dashboard warning lights—particularly the check engine light and the traction control indicator—would sporadically illuminate, especially noticeable during cold starts in the early morning. Additionally, she reported episodes of slight stalling when accelerating from a stop, which unsettled her given the relatively low mileage and recent routine maintenance.

Alex R., a certified technician at Lakeside Honda, conducted the initial intake by thoroughly interviewing Mrs. T. about the symptoms, frequency, and conditions under which these issues occurred. Alex then connected the vehicle to the diagnostic scan tool and retrieved fault codes P145C, which indicated an evaporative emission system fault, and P1172, associated with the air-fuel ratio sensor circuit. Despite these codes, a physical examination revealed no obvious vacuum leaks, disconnected hoses, or wiring faults that could be identified through a standard visual check.

Recognizing the need for further investigation and acknowledging the potential complexity, the service department formally opened Case #2024-0934 via the Honda Dealer Support Portal. All scanned diagnostic data, technician notes, and Mrs. T.’s complaint details were uploaded to provide a comprehensive initial case file for Honda’s technical specialists. This formal case initiation triggered the OEM’s technical support process.

By September 10, Lakeside Honda received a response from the assigned Honda Case Manager, Jenny L., who reviewed the initial data and recommended specific next steps for resolving the issue. She directed the dealer’s technical team to reference a recently updated Technical Service Bulletin (TSB #23-117A), which addressed “Intermittent EVAP and Air/Fuel Codes” specifically documented in certain 2021 Civic models. Jenny requested supplementary documentation to support further diagnosis including photos of the faulty sensors, software calibration identifiers from the vehicle’s Engine Control Module (ECM), and the vehicle’s production lot identification code.

Acting swiftly, Lakeside Honda’s service advisor coordinated with the technician to collect the requested images and calibration screenshots. Upon submission, the dealership proactively informed Mrs. T. about the ongoing technical review by Honda and arranged for a complimentary loaner vehicle to minimize inconvenience during the repair process. This step demonstrated Lakeside’s commitment to customer service while awaiting OEM guidance.

On September 12, Jenny L. provided an update confirming that despite the vehicle not qualifying for any open recalls, it did fall within a known affected batch flagged for sensor issues traced back to a particular supplier lot. Honda authorized an immediate overnight shipment of a redesigned air/fuel sensor, specifically part #36531-5PA-J03, to Lakeside Honda at no cost to the customer. They also supplied detailed instructions for ECM reprogramming to ensure compatibility and successful resolution of the fault codes. Importantly, technicians were directed to validate the serial number of the new sensor upon receipt to ensure authenticity and traceability.

By the afternoon of September 13, Lakeside Honda had received the replacement sensor and begun the repair process. The new component was carefully installed, followed by the prescribed ECM software update carried out using Honda’s specialized recalibration toolkit. After installation, Alex ran comprehensive post-repair diagnostics, cleared all previous fault codes, and conducted road tests to verify full operability. The repair process and all outcomes were meticulously documented and uploaded to the OEM case file for tracking and quality assurance purposes.

Mrs. T. returned on September 14 for a follow-up service call. She expressed satisfaction that the Civic had restarted reliably without warning lights reappearing during typical use over the prior two days. To confirm closure and compliance with Honda’s warranty and quality protocols, the Lakeside service manager reached back to the OEM’s case management team, who formally approved the case resolution and logged the vehicle’s repair history into a national bulletin database for ongoing monitoring.

Since that time, Lakeside Honda noticed similar sensor issues emerging in two additional 2021 Civics coming from the same production batch. The service manager flagged these vehicles for preemptive diagnostic checks during upcoming regular service visits to identify and address potential failures early. Honda recognized the dealership’s proactive approach and requested that any further cases include complete sensor batch numbers and detailed repair documentation for enhanced trend analysis.

To complement technical follow-up, Honda’s customer care representatives engaged with Mrs. T. and other affected customers by offering direct phone support, extended warranties under goodwill policies for borderline cases, and clear communications about the manufacturer’s commitment to quality improvements. This multi-channel engagement helped restore customer confidence and reinforced the strong partnership between the OEM and dealer network.

This case underlines the essential nature of transparent and timely collaboration between automaker technical teams and dealership service departments. Lakeside Honda’s detailed data gathering, prompt reporting, and meticulous repair execution, combined with Honda’s effective escalation, field support, and part supply chain responsiveness, together ensured the resolution of a potentially serious field failure. More broadly, the insights gained fed into Honda’s engineering efforts to improve manufacturing controls, demonstrating a continuous improvement culture that benefits both customer satisfaction and product reliability.
