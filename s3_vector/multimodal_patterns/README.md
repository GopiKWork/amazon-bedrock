# Multimodal Automotive Damage Assessment Demo

This demo demonstrates multimodal indexing patterns using automotive damage assessment data, combining text descriptions with actual damage photos using different AI processing approaches.

## What This Demo Shows

**Automotive Use Case:**
- **Use Case**: Automated insurance claim processing with damage photos and descriptions
- **Business Value**: Streamline claims processing, improve accuracy, and reduce manual review time

**Technical Operations:**
- Processes real automotive damage photos alongside text descriptions
- Demonstrates 5 different AI processing patterns for various scenarios
- Creates searchable database of damage cases with rich metadata
- Enables semantic search across both visual and textual information

## Files

- `multimodal_demo.ipynb` - Interactive Jupyter notebook with image display and analysis
- `automotive_damage_demo.py` - Python script version
- `images/` - Sample automotive damage photos (damage_001.jpeg through damage_006.jpeg)
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Running the Demo

### Option 1: Python Script
```bash
uv run multimodal_patterns/automotive_damage_demo.py
```

### Option 2: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended for Visual Analysis)
```bash
# First ensure Jupyter is installed
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then launch with uv run to use correct environment
uv run jupyter lab multimodal_demo.ipynb
```

**Important**: 
1. **Run from project root**: Launch Jupyter from the main project directory (not from multimodal_patterns)
2. **Use the helper script**: The notebook uses `setup_imports.py` to configure paths and find data files
3. **Check setup output**: The first cell will show if all files are found correctly

```bash
# From the main project directory (s3_vector/)
uv run jupyter lab multimodal_patterns/multimodal_demo.ipynb
```

## AI Processing Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Text Pattern
- **What it does**: Processes only written damage descriptions
- **Use case**: When you have detailed written damage reports
- **Example**: "Minor front bumper impact damage. Plastic bumper cover has hairline crack..."

### 2. Hybrid Pattern  
- **What it does**: Combines photos with text descriptions using separate embeddings
- **Use case**: When you have both damage photos and written assessments
- **Example**: Honda Civic bumper photo + damage description

### 3. Full Embedding Pattern
- **What it does**: Creates unified understanding from both images and text
- **Use case**: For comprehensive multimodal search and analysis
- **Example**: BMW collision case with integrated visual and textual analysis

### 4. Describe Pattern
- **What it does**: Generates text descriptions from photos, then processes as text
- **Use case**: When you have photos but limited written descriptions
- **Example**: Automatically describing Toyota Camry door dent from photo

### 5. Summarize Pattern
- **What it does**: Condenses lengthy reports into key points before processing
- **Use case**: For long dealer escalation cases and detailed documentation
- **Example**: Multi-page dealer escalation case summarized into searchable content

## Sample Damage Cases

The demo includes real automotive damage scenarios:

1. **Honda Civic** - Front bumper crack with paint scratches ($1,200 repair)
2. **Toyota Camry** - Side door dent from parking lot incident ($350 repair)  
3. **BMW X5** - Severe rear-end collision with trunk damage ($8,500 repair)
4. **Ford Explorer** - Side impact with door and panel damage ($4,200 repair)
5. **Chevrolet Malibu** - Hail damage across multiple panels ($2,800 repair)
6. **Nissan Altima** - Front-end collision with airbag deployment ($6,100 repair)

## What You'll See in the Notebook

### Visual Analysis
- Display of actual damage photos with descriptions
- Side-by-side comparison of different processing patterns
- Interactive search results with image thumbnails

### Search Examples
- "Honda bumper damage" - finds relevant Honda cases
- "dashboard warning lights" - locates dealer escalation cases
- "collision damage" with metadata filtering
- "expensive repair high cost damage" - finds severe damage cases

### S3 Vector Store Integration
- View stored metadata and vector information
- Understand how images and text are indexed
- See S3 object references for stored content

## Key Benefits for Insurance Industry

### Automated Claims Processing
- **Visual Recognition**: Automatically identify damage types from photos
- **Cost Estimation**: Find similar historical cases for accurate pricing
- **Fraud Detection**: Compare damage patterns with known legitimate cases
- **Quality Control**: Ensure consistent damage assessment across adjusters

### Operational Efficiency
- **Faster Processing**: Reduce manual review time from hours to minutes
- **Consistent Evaluation**: Standardized damage assessment criteria
- **Knowledge Retention**: Capture and reuse expert adjuster knowledge
- **Scalable Operations**: Handle increasing claim volumes without proportional staff increases

## Technical Architecture

```
Damage Photo + Description → AI Processing Pattern → Vector Embedding → S3 Vector Store
                                      ↓
Search Query → Semantic Search → Retrieve Similar Cases → Display Results with Images
```

## Prerequisites

- AWS credentials with S3 Vector and Bedrock permissions
- Sample damage photos in the images/ directory
- Multimodal processing capabilities
- Understanding of computer vision concepts

## Real-World Applications

### Insurance Companies
- Automated first notice of loss processing
- Damage severity scoring and routing
- Repair cost estimation and validation
- Fraud pattern detection and analysis

### Auto Repair Shops
- Damage documentation and tracking
- Parts ordering based on similar repairs
- Quality control and before/after comparisons
- Training materials for new technicians

### Fleet Management
- Incident documentation and analysis
- Maintenance pattern recognition
- Risk assessment and prevention
- Insurance claim support and documentation

## Next Steps

After running this demo:
1. Integrate with claims management systems
2. Add automated damage severity scoring
3. Implement real-time photo processing APIs
4. Build mobile apps for field adjusters
5. Create analytics dashboards for claim patterns
6. Develop automated repair cost estimation models

This multimodal approach transforms how automotive damage is processed, understood, and acted upon, making insurance operations more efficient and customer experiences more responsive.
