# AWS NotebookLM

This repository contains the code for the blogpost "Reimagining NotebookLM's Podcast Generator with AWS". This explores how to create a powerful podcast generation tool inspired by Google's NotebookLM feature, leveraging AWS and open-source technologies. This solution combines language capabilities of Claude 3.5 Sonnet model on Amazon Bedrock with the power of Amazon Polly to perform audio synthesis.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: A Python library for building interactive web applications
- PyPDF: A library for extracting text from PDF documents
- Amazon Bedrock: A suite of AI models, including the Claude 3.5 Sonnet language model
- Amazon Polly: A text-to-speech service that converts text into lifelike speech
- Pydub: A Python library for audio manipulation and combining audio segments

## Getting Started

After cloding the repository, open [launcher notebook](launcher.ipynb). It has instructions to create a conda environemtn, install dependencies and launch the streamlit application. 


Happy podcasting!
